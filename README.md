While I enjoyed my time in testing, my interest shifted towards DevOps, particularly in automation, continuous integration, and delivery. To prepare for this transition, I pursued several online courses in DevOps practices, including learning tools like Linux bash scripting, git, Jenkins, docker and Kubernetes. I also gained hands-on experience with cloud platforms like AWS, which are crucial for modern DevOps workflows. I believe my background in testing gives me a unique perspective that will add value in a DevOps role. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my analytical skills and passion for process improvement to contribute to a DevOps team. Thank you for considering my application.

1. What is the functionality of Virtual Machine?

   **Functionality**: VMs operate on a physical machine known as the host, while the VMs themselves are referred to as guests. Each VM runs in its own isolated environment, which means multiple VMs can run simultaneously on a single host without interfering with each other.
   
    **Hypervisor Role**: The management of VMs is handled by a hypervisor, which allocates the host's resources (like CPU, memory, and storage) to the VMs as needed (Eg: VirtualBox, VMware, etc)
