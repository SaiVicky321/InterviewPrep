Devops interview preparation- questions with answers

1. Tell me about yourself

    This is the most common question and interview starting question. Start answering the questions in below order.

        1. Name and place
        2. your Degree and Year of passing
        3. Current Work experience
        4. Explain what you are going dat-to-day work
        5. What you learned in this work experience
        6. Transition to devops
        7. Reason of transition to devops
        8. What learnings you did to achieve this 
        9. End up by showing interest towards devops.

   This is how you have to answer this question (Transition from different domain to Devops)

     Hello, My name is <Name>, Born and brought up in <Native_Place>, i graduated with a degree in <Degree> in <Year_of_Completion> and have been working as <Cuurent_Role> in <Company_name> for past <No_of_Yrs> years. In this role, i developed a strong foundation in <Current_Domain_and_Explain> (Eg. software testing and quality assurance, where i was responsible for designing testcases, executing tests and ensuring the quality of the software products. This experiance taught me the importmance of collabaration, commiunication and problem-solvin within cross-functional teams. While I enjoyed my time in testing, my interest shifted towards DevOps, particularly in automation, continuous integration, and delivery. To prepare for this transition, I pursued several online courses in DevOps practices, including learning tools like Linux bash scripting, git, Jenkins, docker and Kubernetes. I also gained hands-on experience with cloud platforms like AWS, which are crucial for modern DevOps workflows. I believe my background in testing gives me a unique perspective that will add value in a DevOps role. I’m excited to leverage my analytical skills and passion for process improvement to contribute to a DevOps team. Thank you for considering my application.

2. Explain the projects you have worked on?


3. What's DEVOPS  / Explain DEVOPS.

    Devops is a set of practices that combine software development (DEV) and IT Operation (OPS) to shorten the software development lifecycle and deliver high quality softwares continuously. Its mainly focuses in automation, continuous Integration, testing & monitoring to steamline workflows, minimize manual errors and reliable software delivery.
 





1. What is the functionality of Virtual Machine?

   **Functionality**: VMs operate on a physical machine known as the host, while the VMs themselves are referred to as guests. Each VM runs in its own isolated environment, which means multiple VMs can run simultaneously on a single host without interfering with each other.
   
    **Hypervisor Role**: The management of VMs is handled by a hypervisor, which allocates the host's resources (like CPU, memory, and storage) to the VMs as needed (Eg: VirtualBox, VMware, etc)

 What is git?
Git is a distributed version control system that is used to track changes in source code during software development. It permits multiple developers to work on a project together without interrupting each other’s changes. Git is especially popular for its speed, and ability to manage both small and large projects capably.

What is a repositories in git?

A Git repository (or repo) is like a file structure that stores all the files for a project. It continues track changes made to these files over time, helping teams work together evenly. Git can control both local repositories (on your own machine) and remote repositories (usually hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), allowing teamwork and backup.



What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git

Git is a version control system used to track changes in files over time

It runs locally on your computer

Git can be used offline, as it operates locally on your machine.

GitHub

GitHub is a platform where Git repositories can be stored and shared

It is a cloud-based service

GitHub requires an internet connection because it is hosted on the web

What is origin in git?
In Git, “origin” states to the default name offered to the remote repository from which local repository was cloned. It is used as a reference to control fetches, pulls, and pushes.

What is the purpose of the .gitignore file?
The ‘.gitignore’ file tells Git which files and folders to ignore when tracking changes. It is used to avoid attaching unneeded files (like logs, temporary files, or compiled code) to your repository. This saves repository clean and targeted on important files only.

What is a version control system (VCS)?
A version control system (VCS) records the work of developers coordinating on projects. It keeps the history of code changes, permitting developers to add new code, fix bugs, and run tests securely. If required, they can restore a past working version, verifying project security.

What is the git push command?
The ‘git push‘ command is used to share local repository changes to a remote repository. It changes the remote repository with the recent commits from the fixed local branch.

What is the git pull command?
The ‘git pull‘ command updates the current local branch with changes from a remote repository and combining it with a local repository

What does git clone do?
The ‘git clone’ forms a copy of a remote repository upon your local machine. It downloads all files, branches, and history, enabling you to start working on the project or contribute to it. With git clone -b , you can download and work on an individual branch of a repository
